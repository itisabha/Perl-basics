\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Maggie the little monkey woke up when the sun was high up in the sky. Another lovely day. Perfect for playing hide and sneak. Off he went to find his friends. First he came across Henry the hippopotamus. \'93Let\'92s play hide and sneak!\'94 he called out from the top of a tree. \'93Not today Maggie,\'94 boomed Henry. \'93There\'92s only three more days till the big fishing competition. I\'92ve got to clean my boat and check for leaks. You should be doing the same, don\'92t you think?\'94 \'93Nah, I\'92ll do it tomorrow.\'94 Just then, who should come along but Lucas the lion. \'93There\'92s no way you\'92d get me anywhere near the water, even in a boat,\'94 he shivered. \'93Come on Maggie, I\'92ll play.\'94 So they played hide and sneak until the sun went down. The next day was sunny again, perfect for racing games. Maggie came across Rose the rhino first. \'93Let\'92s race Rose,\'94 he chattered excitedly. \'93Not today thanks Maggie. It\'92s only two more days until the big fishing competition. I have to fix my motor and get my gear together. I don\'92t want to forget anything! Shouldn\'92t you be getting ready?\'94 \'93Nah, I\'92ll do it tomorrow. Today\'92s a great day for racing. I\'92ll go find Lucas.\'94 Lucas the lion was nearby, lounging in the sun. He loved racing games too, so they played until dinnertime. Maggie woke up next morning to another hot day. Perfect for sliding down Big Hill on banana leaves. Off he went to find Zach the zebra. He loved sliding down Big Hill. \'93No, not today,\'94 said Zach when Maggie found him. \'93Only one day until the big fishing competition. I have to untangle my lines and mend my net. Shouldn\'92t you be getting ready?\'94 \'93Nah, I\'92ll do it tomorrow, before the competition starts. It\'92s the best day today for sliding down Big Hill.\'94 As he was leaving he came across Lucas again. They spent the rest of the day sliding down Big Hill. What a blast! The day sped by all too quickly and it was a very tired Maggie who climbed into bed that night. When he woke up late the next day, he noticed the sun so bright in the sky again. A perfect day for playing, he thought to himself. Then he remembered! It was the day of the big fishing competition! He loved the fishing competition. Last year he\'92d won a prize. He\'92d better get his boat sorted out. He found it where he\'92d left it after his last trip. It was full of old leaves because he hadn\'92t covered it over properly. It took him quite a while to tidy it up. Luckily Lucas came by as he was finishing and helped him drag it down to the water. All his friends were there with their smart looking boats glistening in the sun. \'93Morris, we thought you wouldn\'92t make it!\'94 said Rose the rhino. \'93The competition is about to start. You did check your boat for leaks didn\'92t you?\'94 \'93Oh no, I forgot! Will you help me?\'94 \'93I\'92ll do it with you tomorrow Maggie. I\'92ve got to go line up now,\'94 and off she went. Maggie checked over his boat. He saw three tiny holes. He stuffed them with old leaves scrunched up in mud. As he was finishing the starting buzzer went off and all the motors of the boats zoomed into life. Everyone took off to their favourite fishing spot. Maggie pulled on his motor cord. It coughed and spluttered, but wouldn\'92t start, no matter how hard he tried. So he took out his oars. He could make it to his nearby fishing spot by rowing. When he got there he picked up his fishing rod. It was all tangled up \'97 and he didn\'92t have any bait. Henry the hippopotamus came past in his boat. He\'92d already caught a huge fish and was taking it back to be weighed. \'93Can you help me Henry?\'94 called Maggie. \'93My lines all tangled and I\'92ve no bait.\'94 \'93I\'92ll help you tomorrow Maggie,\'94 came Henry\'92s reply. \'93I\'92ve got to get back. Here\'92s some bait though.\'94 He passed him a small packet before motoring off as fast as a big hippopotamus in a small boat could. It took Maggie ages to untangle his lines. He was concentrating so hard that he didn\'92t notice the water slowly leaking into the bottom of his boat until he\'92d finished. It was only then that he realised his feet were covered in water! \'93Oh no,\'94 he groaned. \'93I better start bailing out the water.\'94 He looked around for his bucket, but it wasn\'92t there. Zach the zebra motored over to him. \'93Please help me Zach,\'94 called Maggie. \'93I\'92m taking on some water.\'94 Zach looked into his boat. \'93You\'92ll be all right, I can\'92t stop now. I\'92ll help you fix the leak tomorrow. Here\'92s my bucket though.\'94 Off zoomed Zach. Maggie bucketed and bucketed. He had nearly got rid of all the water when all of a sudden the hole burst and turned into a gaping mouth gushing water faster than Maggie could bail it out. He was about to sink so he tightened the straps on his life jacket, stood up and jumped into the water. Brrr, it sure was cold! He rolled over onto his back and starting to kick himself back to land. Suddenly he heard Lucas calling out to him, and then there he was in a dinghy, reaching out to help him up. \'93I thought you didn\'92t like the water?\'94 gasped Maggie. \'93I don\'92t, but I saw you jump out of your boat through my binoculars, and I knew that rescuing you was the one job I couldn\'92t wait till tomorrow to do.\'94 Maggie shook his head sadly. \'93I think there are lots of jobs I won\'92t be leaving till tomorrow from now on.\'94}
